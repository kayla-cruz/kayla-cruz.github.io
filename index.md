### CPSC 120 | Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 2, part 1

    I enjoyed this lab because it really helped me understand the mechanics of c++ and the basics of using a terminal and Github. For example, how to use git clone, git add, and git commit, as well as how to use VS Code. It was also fun using the operators in c++ to get the terminal to prompt the answer. Overall this lab was the most helpful to me and set the stage for future labs.

* Lab 4, part 2

    This was another one of my favorite labs because I learned how to use if-else statements. It was challenging but fun writing if-statements and nested if-statements to get the correct output. The lab was also fun because it was my first time programming a game and I felt very accomplished when I was able to complete the lab. This lab made me feel very comfortable using if-statements.

* Lab 8, part 1

    This lab was my favorite because it was very simple but I still learned a lot. I learned a lot using if statements and operators together. As well as using vectors and arguments to get the correct output. The lab was also fun because I liked the goal of combining different arguments to get a correct order of sandwiches! Overall, I learned a lot about using vectors along with if-else statements.
